# Wikipedia preview box (summary)

Version 1.0.0, December 10, 2021, df

## How-to
After the following step(s), all links to a Wikipedia article on your website will automatically display a preview box with the article summary that pop up on mouseover or a fingertip.

### 1) Copy, paste & go!

``Add the following line of code to the bottom of your web page (right before the </body> tag), that's all - nothing else is needed.``
```
<script src="https://su-pa.net/wikiPrevBox/wikiPreviewBox.min.js"></script>
```

### 2) Or alternatively, grab the code and host it yourself
``Copy the folder "wikiPrevBox" to the root of your website and insert the following line of code at the bottom of your web page. See the comments in the source files if you want to edit it. `` 
```
<script src="/wikiPrevBox/wikiPreviewBox.min.js"></script>
```
<br>

### **SETTINGS** (optional)
### **Affects all preview boxes** 
are part of the ```<script ...>```-tag; currently you can set two parameters:
>data-wikipreview="noimages"\
data-wikipreview="width=*value*"

**Example:**
```
<script data-wikipreview="noimages,width=250" src="..."></script>
```
- `noimages`  
If this value is set, only the summary texts and no images are shown; this can help to reduce traffic in places with poor network conditions; or show only the images you like (by using`#showimage` - see below).
- `width=...`  
 Width of the preview boxes, number of pixels, value between 200 and 400, default is 300.  
 <br>
   
### **Affects a specific preview box** 
are part of a Wikipedia link; currently you can set two parameters:
>#nopreview\
#showimage

**Example:**
```
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanyu#nopreview">Orchid Island</a>
```
- `#nopreview`  
Does not show the Wikipedia preview box for a given link, but resets it to a common link to a Wikipedia article.
- `#showimage`  
Set this, if you have used `noimages` in the `<script ...>` tag (see above) but still want to show a picture in a specific Wikipedia preview box. This gives you the ability to take control of when an image is displayed inside a preview box.
<br><br> 

### **Customize via Stylesheet**
You can overwrite the CSS rules of the preview boxes in your own stylesheet, e.g.

`a.wikiLink::after {color: #212427 !important;}`		      /* *set the color of the 'W' next Wikipedia links, default is 'inherit'* \*/\
`a.wikiLink::after {font-size: 0.8em !important;}`		      /* *size of the 'W', default is 0.7em* \*/\
`a.wikiLink {color: darkgreen;}`		      /* *color of the Wikipedia link* \*/\

... override any CSS rules you like to do; use `!important` if  necessary; you will find all rules in the stylesheet **wikiPreviewBox.css**

## Future plans, ideas
- Offline/cache features, prevent doing same things twice (reduce electron travels:)
- Custom text lenght of (a specific) preview box(es)
- Simpler 'W' settings (color & size) without stylesheet 
- Portrait modus on mobile: show image next to the summary text
- ...
